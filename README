// GENERAL INFO //
BADV-Project is a personal project which aims to simplify development for, Adventure (Novel/Text based) game that is quite common in Japan.
This is a browser tool? for the developers to create ADV games. 
The software it self is written JavaScript with jQuery library codes. It also includes jQuery plugin from various authors.
It requires HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with jQuery in order to run properly.
- HTML5 and CSS3 are for, of course for the page's layout.
- JavaScript with jQuery library are needed to run it.
- Basically everything are in the browsers, you will just need to include the jQuery library and the core file into the HTML file to run.

// SIMPLE HISTORY //
This project had started from April, year 2012. The initial version(BADV) was scrapped / deprecated because of the late adapt-ion of jQuery and,
the deprecation of Audio Data API.
The second version(RE:BADV) was finished but was not released because of it's difficult usability.
Now, the current on going third version(BADV-TRE) is a work in progress. I am working on it from scratch again with salvaged code from the previous version.
BADV-TRE plans to be a simple, KIRIKIRI code compatible version.

For more precise? information, please refer to the specified version's source code.

// PROFILE? //
Do mind that the author myself, KiddoKenshin is still an amateur programmer and it is still new to the OpenSource community.
The code inside this project might look horrible and disgusting.
Therefore, I would like to have feedback for it to improvement my code.
OR, be a contributor for my project. Seriously, doing it alone takes a lot of time when you have a job in your real life.

// FUTURE THOUGHTS? //
This project is aiming for OpenSource distribution. Everyone can use, modify it the way they want.
Will be submit a request for OSI License Review when I'm ready to release.
Plans to submit it as a MIT License software.
JAPANESE documentation / comments? Developers & Programmers are suppose to be able to understand English.
I will think about it.
